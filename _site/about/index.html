<div class="aboutwrapper">
<div id="mission">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="mission">Galapagos Conservancy (GC) is dedicated exclusively to the long-term protection of the Galapagos Islands. This single focus allows us to maximize the impact of the financial investments of our members, who include individuals and institutions that care deeply about the Galapagos Islands and understand the scientific importance of preserving this extraordinary ecosystem.</p>
    
    <p>Collectively, our members represent the largest source of private funding for Galapagos conservation. Our direct support to on-the-ground research and management has more than doubled since 2004. We are committed to strengthening local institutions and to creating local capacity to ensure long-term protection of the archipelago.</p>

    <p>We leverage our resources by working in close partnership with many allies, the most central to our work being the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. We are fortunate to collaborate with scientists from many U.S. universities, international non-governmental organizations, and a multitude of other institutions that are committed to Galapagos conservation.</p>

    <p>Galapagos Conservancy believes in the power of collaboration and investments in local capacity. As a result, GC has avoided increasing its footprint (physical infrastructure, staff, etc.) in Galapagos, favoring investments in local and national organizations that, in the long run, will have the authority and responsibility for protecting this extraordinary world treasure. We are dedicated to our role as facilitator and catalyst, having worked “behind the scenes” for almost two decades with leadership at the Galapagos National Park, the Charles Darwin Research Station, local municipalities in Galapagos, and other NGOs.</p>

    <p>By building partnerships and leveraging already existing capacities within Galapagos organizations, we can enhance what already exists to achieve greater success.  Our institutional mission and objectives are completely aligned with the work of key conservation institutions in Galapagos and with the Government of Ecuador.</p> 

    <p>Our staff is fortunate to be able to call on an extraordinary network of international scientists and their institutions to help us answer questions and respond to critical issues. We turn to these experienced Galapagos scientists to provide context and perspective, as well as lead short-term projects designed to answer key conservation management questions posed by the Galapagos National Park Service.  Other characteristics that set us apart include:
    <ul>
        <li>Galapagos Conservancy focuses exclusively on Galapagos, while other international conservation organizations may have programs fluctuate and change based on institutional priorities.</li>
        <li>Galapagos Conservancy staff has extensive experience in Galapagos.</li>
        <li>Galapagos Conservancy partners with the key organizations in Galapagos that work in both conservation and development of a sustainable society. </li>
        <li>We are part of an international network of “Friends of Galapagos” organizations (FOGOs) that works cooperatively to combine resources and experiences to address key issues in Galapagos.</li>     
    </ul>
Our work is focused and agile, and we are able to target financial support immediately to an issue and provide technical backup where needed. </p>

<div id="history">
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Galapagos Conservancy (GC) is the only US organization focused exclusively on protecting the unique ecosystems and biological integrity of the Galapagos archipelago.</p>

    <p>GC was created through the merger of two institutions, the Darwin Scientific Foundation (DSF), founded in 1985, and Charles Darwin Foundation, Inc. (CDF, Inc.), founded in 1992.</p>

    <p>Although DSF and CDF, Inc. were two separate organizations with different Boards of Directors, they shared an Executive Director. In 2001, the institutions merged and became CDF, Inc., a Delaware public charity. Beginning in 2001, CDF, Inc. took a more proactive role in targeting funding and other resources not only for biodiversity conservation but also for social science research. In 2006, CDF, Inc. changed its name to Galapagos Conservancy to better reflect its mandate. With this change, GC became even more self-directed in its program activities.
For more than 25 years, GC has worked with Galapagos-based, national, and international organizations and individuals to ensure the scientific research needed for policy, decision making, and conservation management, and to support key management institutions working in Galapagos to help ensure that they remain strong and effective.</p>

    <p>GC has provided financial and technical support to Galapagos conservation, channeling tens of millions of dollars in private support, and building an endowment, which now stands at $4.2MM in net worth. The organization’s single focus has allowed it to target its communications, funding, and technical resources to projects specific to Galapagos biodiversity conservation and to work with organizations and individuals whose vision and mission are aligned with these goals.</p>

<div id="partners">
    <h2>Our Partners</h2>
    <p>The success of any conservation program requires the development of strong partnerships with a wide range of organizations to create a multifaceted approach toward a united goal.
Galapagos Conservancy’s conservation successes would not be possible without the guidance and support of many partners, including environmentally-conscious travel companies, national and international government organizations, academic institutions and students, and dedicated NGOs.</p>

    <h4>Ms. Carol Townsend and Dr. Charles “Jay” Cole</h4>
    <p>Ms. Carol Townsend and Dr. Charles “Jay” Cole may very well win the prize for most visits to the Galapagos Islands, having made more than 25 trips! Carol and Jay, both biologists with the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), made their first trip to the Islands with AMNH in 1981 and returned most recently with their family in 2014. According to Carol, “We never think of a visit as the last one!”</p>
    <p>Carol and Jay learned of Galapagos Conservancy a few decades ago while visiting the Charles Darwin Research Station, and have been impressed with the success of tortoise conservation efforts over the years. “It is wonderful to think of tortoise populations being restored to historical numbers — a Galapagos we will never see, but something exciting to support!” They also believe that the future of Galapagos conservation depends on local education. “Galapagos Conservancy’s educational program to inform Galapagos residents will help develop local and national interest in conserving the islands.”</p>
    <p>Carol and Jay are long-time supporters of Galapagos Conservancy, having been loyal members since 1993. In addition to making annual gifts, they also have been generous monthly contributors in our Galapagos Guardians Society since 2008. And as the ultimate demonstration of their commitment to Galapagos conservation, they have joined our Legacy Society, designating a portion of their estate to Galapagos Conservancy in their will.
According to Jay, “Watching Galapagos Conservancy at work over many years, we wish all members would double their annual contributions. Their money would be put to good use!” Galapagos Conservancy is grateful for their unwavering financial support and vote of confidence. A special thank you to Carol and Jay for their continued commitment to the conservation and preservation of the wild and wonderful Galapagos Islands!</p>
    <h4>Judie Muggia</h4>
    <p>For more than 50 years, Judie Muggia has been an active member of the Winchester, MA community, serving on the town’s Board of Selectmen and supporting numerous causes and organizations. Judie has also been active in the Galapagos Islands and Ecuador — a second home to Judie, as her husband grew up in Quito before traveling to the States to study and practice medicine.</p>
    <p>In 1998, Judie founded Galapagos Direct, a tour business specializing in personalized travel to Galapagos and mainland Ecuador. She has always been a strong believer that it is important for the Galapagos tourism industry to support conservation and to play a role in protecting the Islands. “I believe that it is incumbent upon those of us who derive both pleasure and income from introducing people to the Galapagos Islands to give back. We must both educate our clients about the fragility and importance of the islands and share our time and financial resources with local programs that ensure the long-term protection of this world treasure.”</p>
    <p>Over the years, Judie supported a number of different education and community conservation initiatives in Galapagos, including training in different fields for promising local youths and formative after-school programs. But she was always looking for a way to have a more strategic and profound impact. In 2013, Judie contacted Galapagos Conservancy and shared her belief that education is the key for long-term conservation in the Islands. She learned about GC’s Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) Program, which was in the early stages of development, and agreed to fund two scholarships through Galapagos Conservancy to sponsor students at the Tomás de Berlanga School, which is being developed as a demonstration school for the Islands.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Judie helped move the ESD Program forward by funding a participatory planning process in which a team of education experts from Ecuador, the US, and Mexico worked closely with the Ecuadorian Ministry of Education and the Galapagos education community to develop a roadmap for deep educational reform in the Islands. Recently, she agreed to fund the Program Director/Educational Leadership Coach who will put these ideas into action, later this year.</p>
    <p>“For me, someone who has been looking for years for an effective way to invest in local education, the ESD Program is a dream come true! The key to its success will be the commitment of Galapagos Conservancy’s leadership to establish a partnership for lasting education reform that involves the Galapagos-based Scalesia Foundation, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Education, a talented team of international education experts, local teachers and school directors, and local families in the islands.”</p>
    <p>Judie is retiring from the tourism industry this summer, but she remains committed to ensuring that Galapagos youth are educated to understand and assume a pivotal role in shaping a sustainable society in the Islands. GC’s work in this area would be impossible without her vision and commitment.</p>
